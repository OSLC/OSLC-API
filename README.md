The repository contains YAML files based on the LDP 1.0, OSLC 2.0, and OSLC 3.0 specifications.
All of the code allows one to interact with the HTTP methods within the YAML files using Swagger UI.
Swagger UI displays the swagger.yaml file on the highest level of the file, which contains all of the
YAML files for each service.

You can access the Swagger UI version at http://oslc-ui.mybluemix.net.
